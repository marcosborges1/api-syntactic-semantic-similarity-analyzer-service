# API Syntactic-Semantic Analyzer (ASSESA)

## Overview

ASSESA is a core component of the `Agape` approach responsible for enhancing the outputs generated by the [API Syntactic Similarity Analyzer (ASSA)](https://github.com/marcosborges1/api-syntactic-similarity-analyzer-service). While ASSA focuses primarily on syntactic connection points, ASSESA advances this analysis by incorporating **semantic similarity metrics**, **combined rankings**, and **syntactic-semantic evaluations**. The ultimate outcome is the generation of **syntactic-semantic connection points**, providing a deeper and more accurate classification of API integration opportunities.

Detailed descriptions of these outputs follow below.

### Semantic Similarity Metrics – Short Text Algorithms

The semantic similarity metrics are computed over API attribute descriptions using short text similarity algorithms, all normalized from 0 to 1. The algorithms currently supported are:

- **BERT**: Transformer-based model trained on masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks, enabling contextual embeddings for sentence-level comparison.
- **RoBERTa**: An optimized variant of BERT trained with larger datasets and longer sequences, improving semantic alignment in text similarity.
- **T5**: A sequence-to-sequence transformer that reformulates NLP tasks into a text-to-text paradigm, delivering robust similarity scoring.
- **BART**: A denoising autoencoder combining bidirectional and autoregressive transformers, applied effectively for semantic similarity computations.

---

### Associated Rankings

ASSESA provides two semantic rankings derived from the similarity metrics:

1. **avg_sem_rank**: The average score across all implemented short text similarity algorithms, representing a balanced view of semantic closeness.
2. **major_syn_rank**: The maximum index from the similarity algorithms for a given tuple, emphasizing the strongest similarity signal detected.

### Syntactic-Semantic Evaluation

The syntactic-semantic evaluation leverages both syntactic and semantic analyses to refine API connection point classification. It includes the following fields:

- **Prediction**: A binary field (`0` or `1`) indicating whether a tuple is recommended as a valid connection point.
- **Correct**: A binary field (`0` or `1`) representing the ground truth validation, provided manually or during prediction assessments.

Evaluations are based on:

- **Syntactic Analysis**: Matching of attributes (`Oa Out Attr` and `Ta In Attr`).
- **Semantic Analysis**: Comparison of attribute descriptions (`Oa Out Attr Descr` and `Ta In Attr Descr`).

This dual analysis aims to increase the reliability of integration point detection.

### Visualizations

ASSESA supports the creation of visual tools to aid interpretation, such as:

- Semantic Correlation Charts
- Ranking Distribution Plots
- Accuracy/Recall/Precision Dashboards

These provide comprehensive insights into the performance and reliability of syntactic-semantic classifications.

## Algorithm

The ASSESA algorithm integrates semantic similarity scoring into the syntactic outputs provided by ASSA, producing a refined set of syntactic-semantic connection points.

## Implementation Details

The ASSESA service is implemented in Python, ensuring modularity and compatibility with the existing Agape ecosystem. By extending the functionality of ASSA, ASSESA leverages both syntactic and semantic perspectives, aligning with the **Systems-of-Information-Systems** context where robust interoperability is crucial.

---

## Setup

Install dependencies before running the service:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

To start the ASSESA service:

```bash
python server.py
```

Access ASSESA from the GraphQL endpoint:

```bash
http://localhost:4004/graphql
```

**Note**:

- The default PORT is _4004_, but it can be configured.
- Like ASSA, ASSESA relies on GraphQL for efficient querying and integration. To learn more, visit the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/).

## Project Status

ASSESA is currently in its experimental phase, working as a **proof of concept**. Continuous refinements are being applied to enhance semantic robustness, improve rankings, and extend evaluation metrics.
